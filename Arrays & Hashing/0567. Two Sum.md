# Two Sum

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Pattern:** Arrays & Hashing  
**Language:** cpp  
**LeetCode:** https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

---

## Intuition
i've to find two numbers  which should equal to target and problem says exactly one solution is there ,  brute force:is using two loops and finding each possibility .
 else if i find only   the need =target - current index

---

## Approach
i"llbe using hashmap to store current value

---

## Example Walkthrough
_Walk through a small example to show how the logic works._

---

## Time Complexity
o(n)

---

## Space Complexity
o(n-1)

---

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int need = target - nums[i];
            if (mp.find(need) != mp.end()) {
                int j=mp[need];
                res.push_back(i);
                res.push_back(j);
                break;
            }
            mp[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
