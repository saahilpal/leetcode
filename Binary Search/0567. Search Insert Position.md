# Search Insert Position

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Pattern:** Binary Search  
**Language:** cpp  
**LeetCode:** https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/

---

## Intuition
Use binary search on the sorted array.

Move left if nums[mid] > target, move right if nums[mid] < target.

When the loop ends, low is the correct insert position.

---

## Approach
Apply binary search on the sorted array.

Initialize low = 0 and high = n - 1.

Compute mid and compare nums[mid] with the target.

If equal, return mid.

If the target is greater, set low = mid + 1.

Otherwise, set high = mid - 1.

If the target is not found, return low as the insert position.

---

## Example Walkthrough
nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 2

low = 0, high = 3

mid = 1 → nums[mid] = 3

3 > 2 → move left

high = mid - 1 = 0

mid = 0 → nums[mid] = 1

1 < 2 → move right

low = mid + 1 = 1

Loop ends (low > high)

Return low = 1

## Time Complexity
o(log n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int low=0,high=nums.size()-1;
        while(low<=high)
        {
            int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
            if(nums[mid]==target)
            return mid;
            else if(nums[mid]>target)
            {
                high=mid-1;
              
            }
            else
            {
                low=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return low;
        
    }
};
